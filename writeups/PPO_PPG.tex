\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) sparked the creation of various algorithms that proposes novel solutions to key problems still faced in RL today, namely sparse rewards and generalization. This paper aims to study PPO and PPG, and draw potential insights of the directions RL field is heading towards.
